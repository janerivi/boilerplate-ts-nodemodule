Installation and Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```


2. Build the project
```console
npm run build
```
3. Run tests
```console
npm test
```

With these configurations, Mocha should be able to find and run your test files, and TypeScript should correctly compile both your source and test files.
